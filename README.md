# Electric Table
Upgrading my height adjustable table from a crank to an electric motor.

I'm doing it with my own solution to get a refresher in my electronics knowledge and to have better control overall.
I have bad experiences with prebuilt soltions were parts break down and no replacements are available (Which is another reason why I'm doing it myself).
